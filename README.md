# You know, I'm something of a programmer myself

My first computer was a Commodore Vic 20 my father bought in early 80s. I was 6 years old and I just rememember that I loved to draw on the screen some kind of ascii art using the "print" command. Played videogames on my Commodore 64 in the years after and started to code some Basic programs on that awesome machine. Started to program in Turbo Pascal, then Visual Basic at school. Also Fortran and C, by myself.

It was 1999 when I realized that this could have become my job, so I learned to develop applications in Visual Basic 6, after in Visual Basic .NET and finally in C#. I started at the meantime to develop web sites and web applications using HTML and Javascript. I was really proud when I coded a huge dynamic web site that showed CSS formatted XML files for my first big client.

Starting from 2001 I always studied a lot and incremented my knowledge in every direction, mainly: .NET, SQL, Java. There were still java applets then and I can rememeber the nights on coding them, what a waste of time!

In all these years I followed all the evolution of architectual and technical world for us "programmers": from SOAP Web Services to Json ones, from raw Javascript to JQuery (I still remember the first time I used it, and how it looked like the "non plus ultra" of front-end programming) and then to Node.js and all the client Frameworks and libraries like React and Vue.
I still remember the moment when we said: ok it is not web hosting, now it's cloud; so we started to develop also for Azure.
I rememer when we switched from VSS to Subversion (and Tortoise) then to Git.
I remember all the issues Sql Server 7.0 had, how painful was to migrate our production databases to Sql Server 2005, all the Stored Procedures and Repositories written line by line, then the big switch to Hibernate and NHibernate, then finally to Entity Framework.
I remember the first CQRS application I coded and all the years spent on studing OOP, Design Patterns, Algorithms, Architecture and every time I discovered and learned something new and useful, refactored or rewrited some applications to make them better.

Last things I learned: React Native in 2019, Blazor and Dart + Flutter in 2021.
Learning is fun!
